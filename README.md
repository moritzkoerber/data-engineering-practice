This repository contains my solutions to the awesome data engineering exercises by Daniel Beach (<https://github.com/danielbeach/data-engineering-practice/>).

To run the solutions, in each respective folder either

- use Docker Compose, or
- install the pipenv virtual environment and run the main.py module.

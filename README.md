This repository contains my solutions to the awsome seven data engineering exercises by Daniel Beach (https://github.com/danielbeach/data-engineering-practice/).

To re-run the solutions, either

- use the Docker Compose files, or
- install the pipenv virtual environment and run the main.py module
in each respective folder.
